Some people prefer reading, some people prefer listening, some people prefer watching videos to learn stuff.
Here are some collected and curated videos related to Javascript.

## Functional Programming in Javascript by MPJ

MPJ, short for Mattias Petter Johansson, was the author of the YouTube channel called _"Fun Fun Function"_, where he talked about programming in general, but also about Javascript in particular. He got a cool series on functional programming which is very short, videos are between 10-15 minutes and to the point. But in particular I like his take on Objet Oriented Programming vs Functional Programming paradigm, because in only 8 minutes he can teach you the core issue with OOP.

This is a suggested ordering for watching some of his videos:

0. [Closures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQqwU2Ixu-U)
1. [Factory Functions in Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImwrezYhw4w)
2. [Composition over inheritance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfMtDGfHWpA)

  Here the first video repeats, is the 5 on the list, but I thought it was better to watch that one first, as this list of videos aims to a different subject, related, but different.

## Douglas Crockford

### Javascript heptalogy

Douglas Crockford is (was?) an eminence in the Javascript scene, here I link a series of old talks were he goes deep into Javascript, tells about some Javascript history and why some things are the way they are, proper ways to code, and much more. In essence I feel these talks are a must watch.

- [Crockford on JavaScript - Volume 1: The Early Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg) 1:42 hs.
  This has not much about Javascript, but gives a good deal of context to understand Javascript later. Why we still use an 80 characters limit on some of our systems? From where does the phrase _"spaghetti code"_ come? It's mostly about history of computers and programming languages.

- [Crockford on JavaScript - Chapter 2: And Then There Was JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO1Wnu-xKoY) 1:30 hs.
  Here he starts with Javascript properly.

  Why the prototypal model is more powerful? Why Java stinks and Javascript is a more powerful language? Taxonomy and classifications are not needed and are hard to make right. Why is preferable to ditch `new`? Traps of the language. Why do we call strings strings? Why arrays are not really arrays and are innefficient in Javascript? Why `with` is no longer in the language? Why we shouldn't use `for..in`?

  Functions.
  You may wish to skip previous videos, but this one is **essential**. Please watch it.

A reduced set of talks, more or less on the same vein as the previous, but more recent.
