# Practice

The best way to learn and the best way to stay sharp and avoid forgetting things, is to practice. This applies to every aspect of our lives, whether you want to become a better cook, improve your physical performance, etc. Even to become a better programmer.

Already linked _Exercism_ site on the main file of this repo, but _Exercism_ is aimed at learning, while here I present sites that are aimed at continuous practice. Never stop practicing!

Choose one of these and start practicing, then continue practicing and finally: never stop practicing.

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
  Besides practicing, some companies use its system to evaluate you, so you better get acustomed to solve problems in this environment. But most important: it has a huge amount of problems ranging from basic to very complex for you to solve.

  Here's my profile in case you want to follow me: [flc](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/FernandoCanizo).

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
  Haven't used it at all, I was aware of its existence but I was too invested in HackerRank by the time I learned about this site, however I just created an account and looks pretty cool.

- [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/)
  You solve problems specific to games, with a game interface. Pretty cool. Companies look for people here too.

- [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)
  I didn't use this one much, I didn't like the idea, but if you are into competing, then this is the place for you. For example, you get a problem and you get matched with another programmer online, then you both compete to be the first one to solve the problem.

- [CodeSignal](https://app.codesignal.com/)
  Haven't used it much, I prefer HackerRank, but some companies use it for tech screens, so it's good to know it and have practiced a little bit on it.
