# Optional Resources

Extra, but still curated, resources to learn several things.

## Git

- [GeeksForGeeks Git Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git-tutorial/)
  More than a tutorial is a meta-tutorial, as it has a truckload of links pointing to almost anything you want to know about git, including history. So if you want to expand your knowledge or learn some advanced stuff, this is a good place to start.

- [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github)
  on Coursera
  A very thorough course to learn Git and GitHub.

- [Git for Beginners: The Definitive Practical Guide](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/git-guide)
  by Mateusz Szablak
  This is a basic tutorial, on the vein of the ones linked in the "essentials", but has some cooler explanations for some things. I could have added it to the essentials list, but there were enough already.

- [Reference and "official" book](https://git-scm.com/doc)
  Here you can find a link to the `git` reference and what I think is the official git book.

## Big-O

- [A Begginners guide to Big-O notation](https://robbell.io/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation)
