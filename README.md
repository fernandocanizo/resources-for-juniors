# Very reduced list of resources for juniors to learn some essentials

A curated list of resources to put junior programmers up to speed to work on a mainly Node.js/Javascript-based development team.

This README file contains the very basic things we think you need to know, but feel free to peruse other files on this repository to check optional resources that may serve to deepen some extra knowledge and/or abilities.

## Linux CLI

We use GNU/Linux distributions, if you want to use a different operating system for developing you are on your own as we don't have the knowledge to properly guide you when things break. So we recommend you start using GNU/Linux, either install an [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) or an [Archlinux-based](https://manjaro.org/) operating system.

- [Comandos de Linux](https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/news/comandos-de-linux/)
  It's essential to learn to move around your new system.

## Javascript

- [JavaScript for impatient programmers](https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/)
  by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer
  (ES2022 edition)
  A good and updated book on Javascript with mostly all you need to know to start developing software. While Javascript is pretty easy to use if you come from other c-like-languages, it has some quirks and details that may surprise you, as they have the same syntax that other languages, but work different. So we recommend you to properly **learn the language**.

- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript)
  Together with the book, you can join the Javascript track on Exercism, and get a bunch of exercises to practice what you learned on the book or from any other sources.

## Some Javascript Essentials

This are short articles on specific Javascript subjects that surely will appear on the previous book, but since these are crucial knowledge, I decided to add this to-the-point articles that are shorter.

- [Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

Javascript is not like other commonly used languages, so it's important you understand some of the inner workings of it's internal engine.

- [A complete guide to the Node.js event loop](https://blog.logrocket.com/complete-guide-node-js-event-loop/)
  by Joseph Mawa on 2023-07-11
  A nice guide but...

- [Event Loop official docs](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/asynchronous-work/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick)
  ...This is the official documentation.

Feel free to read one or the other or both.

## Git

We use `git` and [GitHub](https://github.com) to manage and coordinate the production of our software, so you need to be proficient with `git`. Here are several resources, all teach more or less the same, you don't need to use them all, but you should go through at least one of these:

- [git-it](https://github.com/Git-it-App/git-it-electron)
  by Jessica Lord
  An application that teaches you the basics about using git step-by-step and checks your progress.

- [The Essential Git Handbook â€“ Learn Git for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-essential-git-handbook-a1cf77ed11b5/)
  by Sanjula Madurapperuma
  A good and pretty complete git-basics tutorial.

- [Learn the Basics of Git in Under 10 Minutes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/)
  by Gowtham Venkatesan
  Almost on the same level than Sanjula's tutorial, but this one has a step-by-step part on setting up your GitHub account to use SSH, which is something you will need, so **maybe this should be the right tutorial to start** with.

- [How To Use Git for Beginners](https://www.codecademy.com/article/francineblanc/how-to-use-git-for-beginners)
  by FrancineBlanc
  Has some repeated concepts from the previous tutorial by Sanjula, but this one has content on workflow and collaboration, so it's interesting to look at this too.
