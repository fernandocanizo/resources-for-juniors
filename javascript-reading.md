# Javascript Reading

- Mostly full books, but maybe some loose articles.
- In no particular order.
- Probably a year of reading or more.
- Mostly on the topic of applying functional programming with Javascript.

This is an old list I've been carrying for years, so take it with a grain of salt, because Javascript has undergone a great deal of changes since its inception, in particular from 2015 onward. So check the year of these books and chose one that has an updated edition, hopefully after 2015.

- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)

  A good book to start learning Javascript.

- [So You Want to be a Functional Programmer](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-1-1f15e387e536)

  Articles on _Medium_. Link to Part 1, the rest can be followed from this one. There are 5 parts.

- [You Don't Know JS series](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

  A series of books that go very deep on the inner workings of Javascript. This is an advanced book, not recommended to start learning the language.

## Oldies

- JavaScript: The Good Parts, by Douglas Crockford
  Got no link for this one, but it's a highly recommended and still current book, despite its age. Maybe some parts will be outdated if there's no post-2015 edition, but still, a short book that deserves to be read.

- Effective Javascript
  68 specific ways to harness the power of Javascript
  by David Herman
  published by Addison Wesley on 2012.11

  This is a book oriented to avoid the pitfalls of the language.
  There are several parts of this book that are definitely outdated, but I would that there's still an 80% of the book that's relevant today, in 2024.

## Books I don't know

- [Learn Javascript Quickly](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-JavaScript-Quickly-Programming-Hands/dp/1951791479)

  Found this one when searching for an updated list of suggested books, found many of the ones I already suggested, and this one. I haven't read it, but it has 174 pages, so it should be really a quick book to start learning the language.

- The Joy of Javascript
  by Luis Atencio
  published by Manning on 2021

  Haven't read it, but looking at its subjects looks like a good book to deepen your knowledge after you have read some of the other suggested books to start.

## Typescript

The best resource to start with Typescript is the [official site](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), `Docs` section has several introductory tutorials adapted according to previous context.

Also there lives the [handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html).

Another book I read and recommend is [Learning Typescript](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-typescript/9781098110321/) by Josh Goldberg, from editorial O'Reilly. It has a nice set of pratice exercise to hone acquired knowledge.
